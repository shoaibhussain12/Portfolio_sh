# Portfolio-website
Fully resposive and user friendly website by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

üîç Step 1: Planning & Wireframing

Before writing any code, I defined the purpose and structure of my portfolio:
Decided on the core sections: Hero (intro), About Me, Projects, Skills and Contact.
Focused on keeping the layout minimal, responsive, and user-friendly.

üé® Step 2: Choosing the Tech Stack

I selected the technologies based on my goals and comfort level:

Styling: Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules (for fast and responsive design)
Animations: Framer Motion (for transitions and interactive UI)
Hosting: GitHub Page (for fast and free deployment)



üß© Step 3: Building the Components

I broke the UI into reusable components:

Navbar: for navigation between sections.
Hero: introductory section with name, role and call-to-action
About: a short paragraph about myself and background.
Projects: a list/grid showcasing my work with images and links
Skills: HTML CSS and JavaScript only.
Contact: contact form or direct contact info (email, Linked.)
Footer: optional links or copyright


üåê Step 4: Making It Responsive

Used Flexbox and Grid along with media queries to ensure the layout adapts well to all screen sizes.
Ensured that all text, buttons and images scale properly on mobile, tablet and desktop.


‚ú® Step 5: Adding Animations & Effects

Used Framer Motion (or CSS transitions) to add simple animations like:
Fade-ins when sections enter the viewport
Hover effects on buttons and project cards
Smooth scrolling for navigation


üöÄ Step 6: Deployment

Pushed the code to GitHub.
Deployed and verified everything worked on the live site.
